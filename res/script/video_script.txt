WELCOME

Lieutenant! Look Sharp!

You've been assigned to this clandestine research operation for a reason. We need the best, and that's you.

The XG-13 Lens Coating is an unconventional new weapon, and we need you to test it. Our budget is zero, so you'll be popping balloons with a flashlight until we get funding for something larger.

You board a plane for Area 51 at 0600.

Good luck, Lieutenant. (salutes)

BALLOONS -> BOMBS

Lieutenant! Excellent work.

You convinced the brass to give us some funding, and just in time. The Zapato Cartel is using drones to smuggle drugs over the border. You'll be using an XG-13 coated lens in conjuction with a standard issue searchlight to bring down those drugs before they reach their destination.

Once they figure us out they might launch something a bit more dangerous, so keep your eyes peeled.

Good luck, Lieutenant. (salutes)

BOMBS -> ASTEROIDS

Lieutenant Commander!

Congratulations on your promotion. Your success against the cartels is unparalleled.

You're out here to take the XG-13 program one step further. We're applying the coating to our best telescopes. The Hubble is operational, and the James Webb will be ready soon.

It's imperative that you use these newly coated lenses to stop the incoming meteorite swarm from damaging earth or any of our sattelites.

Good luck, Lieutenant Commander. (salutes)

ASTEROIDS -> SPAAAACE

Lieutenant Commander!

The whole of earth is in your debt. But there's no time to rest.

A gigasupernova thousands of years ago sent several "rogue stars" speeding toward our solar system. Each star could wipe out life as we know it!

Fortunately our scientists have managed to create a miniature black hole out of Jupiter. The gravataional lensing is similar to XG-13.

You know what to do.

Good luck, Lieutenant Commander. (salutes)

GOOD JOB!

Admiral! (Salutes)

Congratulations again on your promotion.

I wanted to thank you for saving us all. The XG-13 project was unusual, but you handled it with ease.

They're shutting down XG-13 - apparently destroying Jupiter annoyed some people. But your heroism will be remembered for generations.

Good luck with your new assignment, Admiral. (salutes)
